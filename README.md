# 2048 Game 🎮

A simple clone of the classic **2048 game**, built using **Python** and **Pygame**.

## 🔢 About

The goal of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid and combine them to reach the **2048 tile**. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one with their sum.

## 📜 History

The original **2048** game was created in **March 2014** by **Gabriele Cirulli**, a 19-year-old web developer from Italy. It was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and quickly went viral due to its simple yet addictive gameplay.  
This project is a Python-based recreation of that popular game using the **Pygame** library.
